Chawan (茶碗) means tea bowl. Bowls used in tea ceremony should have a [[Kodai]] for ease of use during [[Temae]]. 

Chawan with unglazed kodai should be left to soak in water for a few minutes before using them.

To find the [[Shōmen]], turn the chawan upside down and look for the maker’s signature on the kodai. Position it next to your left thumb and turn the chawan over. The side facing you now is the shōmen although depending on the chawan, the [[Teishu]] can arbitrarily define a shōmen.

Valuable tea bowls such as [[Raku]] are highly prized in tea ceremony.
