Chawan (茶碗) means tea bowl. Bowls used in tea ceremony should have a [[Kodai]] for ease of use during [[Temae]]. 

Chawan with unglazed kodai should be left to soak in water for a few minutes before using them.

To find the [[Shōmen]], turn the chawan upside down and look for the maker’s sign on the kodai. Position it next to your left thumb and turn the chawan over. The side facing you is the typical shoumen although depending on the chawan, a shoumen can be defined arbitrarily by the [[Teishu]].

Valuable tea bowls such as [[Raku]] are highly prized in tea ceremony.
