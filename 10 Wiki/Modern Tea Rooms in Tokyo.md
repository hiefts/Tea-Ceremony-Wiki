First Change: The country house trend

Furuta Oribe has said, “Sukiya (tea rooms) must be thatched”. The idyllic look of thatched roofs was not limited to tea rooms, but also long favoured by the imperial family in their property, such as the Fomer Ichijo Ekan Sanso, which was moved from Tokyo to Kamakura.

In the midst of modern urbanisation, the country house look was favoured by tea masters such as Masuda Donno and Dan Takuma. They founded a trend of buying thatched houses deep in the mountains and relocating them to the city.

Not only did they enjoy the wild beauty of the large beams supporting the roof and the sooty bamboo darkened by smoke from the sunken hearth, they also refined the fittings and fixtures with delicate designs to achieve an exquisite balance. Some dictionaries even describe sukiya architecture as "a tatami room built in the style of a country house".

転換１: 田舎家の流行

「数寄屋は茅葺に定めるべし」は古田織部の言葉である。茅葺き屋根の牧歌的な佇まいは茶室だけに留まらず、東京から鎌倉に移築された旧一条恵観山荘など、古くから皇族の別業でも好まれた。

近代の都市化の中で、田舎家の姿は、益田鈍翁や団琢磨といった数寄者たちに好まれた。彼らはこぞって山奥の茅葺きの民家を買い入れ、市中に移築する流行を産み出したのだ。

屋根を支える大梁や囲炉裏の煙で燻された煤竹の野趣を楽しむだけでなく、建具などは繊細な意匠で洗練させて、絶妙なバランスを実現させた。数寄屋造とは「田舎家風の意匠を用いて建てられた座敷の様式名称」とさえ書かれた辞典も出た。
