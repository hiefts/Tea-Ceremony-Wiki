The Kobukusa (小袱紗) is a rectangular patterned cloth that the [[Teishu]] typically carries in their kimono and uses to put [[Utensils]] on during [[Temae]]. For example, when making [[Koicha]], any non-Raku ware [[Chawan]] should always be presented with a kobukusa. For [[Kazarimono]] temae, the kobukusa is also used to cushion and draw attention to the utensil on display. One must always take care to position the kobukusa with its wasa (輪差) pointing in the right direction.
