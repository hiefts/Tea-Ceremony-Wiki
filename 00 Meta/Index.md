This is a wiki collecting Japanese tea ceremony knowledge and resources. Japanese terms are given in Kanji, Hepburn romanization and most common English translation if available. Browse via topics below or tag view (see hashtag button in the menu). 

Entries are added and modified continuously. If you wish to suggest changes or point out mistakes or problems, please do so via the [Github repository page](https://github.com/hiefts/Tea-Ceremony-Wiki). It is appreciated!

*Disclaimer: As the author practices tea in the [[Urasenke]] tradition, this wiki is likely biased in favor of Urasenke.*
